## Overview
Programs for machine learning written in Python, including test data loader, learning algorithms (especcialy for regression) and hyper-parameter optimizers. We are expanding this package to add some new algorithms (e.g.: Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network). We will mainly use pandas.DataFrame object as input.


## Description
testdataloader - Testdataloader is a data set loader for machine learning and returns datasets as pandas.DataFrame object.

learningalgos - Learningalgos includes several algorithms for machine learning.

hypparamsopt - Hypparamsopt is a set of optimizers for machine learning algorithms in Learninalgos described above. 


## Demo
We have 'samples.py' in the same repository to demonstrate the whole process from dataloading to hyper-parameter optimizing for Extra-Trees and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree.


## Requirement
pandas
xgboost
sklearn
GPy
functools
optuna
